# Coffee Sales Analysis

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze and interpret coffee sales data across multiple countries to identify customer preferences, uncover sales patterns, and pinpoint opportunities for business growth. The insights derived from this analysis can guide strategic decision-making and optimize product offerings.

## Project Overview
This project involves a detailed data analysis of three and a half years of coffee sales data across three countries. The goal is to uncover trends in consumer behavior, identify the most popular coffee products, and understand how these preferences evolve over time. By dissecting the sales data by country and time period, the project provides actionable insights that can help in tailoring marketing strategies, enhancing product development, and expanding market reach.

## Key Insights
- **Customer Preferences by Region**: The analysis identifies the most favored coffee types in each country, with Liberica being the most popular in Ireland, Arabica in the US and Excelsa preferred in the UK. This insight allows the business to customize its offerings to align with regional tastes.
  
- **Best-Selling Products**: The analysis identifies the top-selling coffee products, with the most preferred being the light roast in the large (2.5 kg) size, particularly in the US. The project highlights these key revenue drivers, providing insights that guide decisions on product focus and inventory management.

- **Trend Analysis Over Time**: The project tracks changes in consumer preferences over time, noting spikes in Arabica sales in February and September 2020, and a surge in Excelsa sales in January 2022. It also reveals an overall increase in annual sales, with Excelsa's popularity declining while the other three coffee types gain traction. This analysis offers valuable insights into seasonal trends and shifting tastes, which can inform marketing and sales strategies.

- **Growth Opportunities**: The analysis highlights opportunities for market expansion and growth, allowing the company to strategically target new customer segments and optimize existing markets by introducing marketing strategies for the three increasingly popular coffee types. Additionally, the analysis reveals that customers without loyalty cards generate higher revenue, suggesting that offering discounts and bonuses for loyalty card holders could incentivize more customers to purchase them.


## Tools and Techniques:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing ensure the accuracy of the analysis, addressing issues such as missing data and inconsistencies.
  
- **Feature Engineering**: The data was initially normalized and distributed across multiple tables. To enable effective analysis, it was consolidated into a single table, and new features, such as revenue, were created.

- **Data Segmentation**: The data is segmented by country, product type, and time period, allowing for a detailed examination of market dynamics across different regions.

- **Data Visualization**: Interactive visualizations created using Power BI (or similar tools) provide a clear and intuitive understanding of sales patterns, trends, and customer preferences.

- **Data Modeling**: The project employs data modeling techniques to explore relationships between different variables, helping to identify factors that influence sales performance.

## Conclusion
The Coffee Sales Analysis project offers valuable insights into customer behavior and sales trends across different markets. By understanding regional preferences and tracking changes over time, the project equips the business with the knowledge to make informed decisions, optimize product offerings, and strategically drive growth in the coffee market.
