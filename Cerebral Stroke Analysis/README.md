# Cerebral Stroke Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of cerebral stroke data to understand key risk factors, predict patient outcomes, and contribute to ongoing medical research. By categorizing factors into demographic and lifestyle/medical types, the project aims to provide actionable insights that help patients and healthcare providers implement proactive measures to reduce stroke risk.

## Project Overview
This project involves an in-depth examination of cerebral stroke data, focusing on two primary categories of risk factors: demographic and lifestyle/medical. The analysis explores how these factors influence the likelihood of stroke occurrence and aims to enhance understanding of stroke risks, which can inform preventive strategies and medical interventions.

## Key Insights
- **Risk Factor Analysis**: The project investigates how different demographic factors (such as age, gender, occupation, and marital status) and lifestyle/medical factors (including smoking, BMI, and existing health conditions) influence the likelihood of stroke. It reveals that the risk of stroke increases with age, is more prevalent in males compared to females, and that marital status may also contribute to higher stroke risk. Additionally, smoking, being overweight, and having elevated average blood glucose levels are identified as significant risk factors.
  
- **Preventive Recommendations**: The analysis provides actionable recommendations for patients based on identified risk factors, allowing them to take proactive steps to lower their stroke risk. Suggested measures include weight reduction and dietary adjustments to maintain a healthy blood glucose level.

- **Contribution to Medical Research**: The project provides valuable data-driven insights that contribute to broader medical research efforts, supporting advancements in stroke prevention and treatment.
  
- **Outcome Prediction**: By examining data patterns, doctors can assess an individual's likelihood of stroke risk, providing valuable insights for early intervention and the development of personalized treatment plans.


## Tools and Techniques
- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned and prepared to ensure accuracy and reliability. This process involves handling missing values using a decision tree, removing duplicate entries, and normalizing the data.

- **Data Modeling**: For effective data modeling, the data was normalized and organized into separate tables.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Advanced statistical techniques were used to handle imbalances in the dataset and identify significant risk factors and assess their impact on stroke likelihood.

- **Data Visualization**: Interactive visualizations and charts are created to clearly present risk factors, predictions, and recommendations, making the information accessible to both patients and healthcare providers.

- **Predictive Modeling**: The project employs predictive modeling techniques to forecast stroke outcomes based on identified risk factors, aiding in early diagnosis and intervention.

## Conclusion
The Cerebral Stroke Analysis project offers a thorough examination of stroke risk factors and outcomes, providing valuable insights for both patients and medical professionals. By understanding the impact of various demographic and lifestyle/medical factors, the project supports the development of targeted preventive strategies and contributes to ongoing stroke research.
